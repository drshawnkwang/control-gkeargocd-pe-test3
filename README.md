# ArgoCD Control Repo Template

## Instructions

Use this template to create a new ArgoCD Control Repository. This corresponds to a Kubernetes Cluster, and controls deployment of Applications and Resources into this cluster.

You should replace this README file with one appropriate to the cluster this controls. Specifically the cluster the repo controls and add any cluster-specific instructions.
